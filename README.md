# java-maven-project

In this project, we developed a distributed software system using Java and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to store and access audio files with their 
relevant attributes. Our system is thread-safe and uses an executor and concurrent hash map to handle client requests. We have also created an OpenAPI 
specification on SwaggerHub to document the system's endpoints and operations. The system has been deployed on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and is 
functioning as intended.

URL to the project: http://168.138.93.110:9090/coen6731/audio

To test the project, you can use Postman and try accessing the URL.

In addition, an OpenAPI specification has been created using SwaggerHub to document the endpoints and operations of our distributed software system for storing audio items. This standardized documentation helps developers to interact with the system's API. You can access the SwaggerHub link here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ITSVISHRUTHKHATRI/Audio/1.0.0

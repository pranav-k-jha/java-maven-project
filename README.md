# java-maven-project

In this project, we developed a distributed software system using Java and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to store and access audio files with their 
relevant attributes. Our system is thread-safe and uses an executor and concurrent hash map to handle client requests. We have also created an OpenAPI 
specification on SwaggerHub to document the system's endpoints and operations. The system has been deployed on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and is 
functioning as intended.
